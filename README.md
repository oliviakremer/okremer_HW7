# The purpose of this assignment is to become familiar with the HTML and CSS necessary to create a webform and design considerations when building forms. The main goal of this webform is to collect data about undergraduate student lifestyles. 

# In Digital Product Management, I designed a web form that adheres to best practices for web form design. I focused on making the form simple and easy to use, with clear and concise language and logical sections that guide the user through the form.

# Throughout the survey, I collected information on the students name, gender, number of majors, and what their majors are. This information can help track the student's responses and allow for further analysis of the data. Understanding the majors of the respondents can help determine if certain majors have particular perceptions or experiences related to the survey topic.

# To make the form accessible to all users, I used appropriate color contrasts, font sizes, and ensured compatibility with different devices and browsers. I also ensured that the form is keyboard navigable, which helps users with different abilities easily access and complete the form.

# Overall, I believe the web form I designed creates a positive user experience for anyone who uses it. By following best practices for web form design, I feel confident that I have demonstrated my skills as a web developer and created a form that is user-friendly and accessible to all.
